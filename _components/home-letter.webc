        <p>dear reader <i>(and in fact, dear friend)</i>,</p>
        <p>this version of my website represents my first attempt at growing a digital garden â€” a place for rough
            drafts
            and indecipherable scrawling; for seedlings of ideas to be tended and stand tall in the fields.</p>
        <p>tread carefully, as the ground</br>
            may have shifted.</p>
        <p>love,<br />
            henry <i>(from online)</i></p>
