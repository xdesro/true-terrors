## TL;DR

One of my most-frequently searched dev tasks over the course of my career thus far has been the "how do I find what process is on a port" to ‚Äúhow do I kill a given process‚Äù wombo-combo ‚Äî there‚Äôs always some memory-leaky service running that <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> isn‚Äôt tough enough for. Figured it‚Äôd be good to write a quick shell function for doing just this. Before I get into the explainer, here‚Äôs the code:

```sh
function killport {
	echo 'üö® Killing all processes at port' $1
	lsof -ti tcp:$1 | xargs kill
}
```

This bad boy can also be found as a [script in Gist form on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/xdesro/e7bbec9b2a1c31f0c04a1e2d22597dd8).

Sorry, this guide doesn‚Äôt currently solve for Windows or Linux systems, as far as I know. If y‚Äôall have an analogous solution, I‚Äôd happily include it in this post :){.editors-note}

## Finding the offending process

After defining our function and adding some cute helper text, we can use `lsof` (list open files) to find processes that match our criteria. The manual for the `lsof` says:

> An open file may be...a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket.)

Sounds like exactly what we‚Äôre on the hunt for. We‚Äôll pass a couple of options to make this work as a function:

- `-t`: The lower-case version of the `-T` flag sets some preferences for the output we get from running `lsof`. Specifically, `-t` returns only the PID, which is useful for piping this output to the `kill` command.
- `-i`: This flag tells `lsof` to specifically look for matching internet addresses. We can pass the port we‚Äôre looking for in the format `[protocol]:[port]`.

The protocol will be TCP, and then we can use a bash _positional parameter_ to accept the port number as an argument to our `killport` function:

```sh
lsof -ti tcp:$i
```

## Killing in the port of

Now that we have the `PID` of the process that is running on the port we want closed, we can send that over to the `kill` command. We‚Äôll use a bash pipe and the `xargs` command to pass that information on.

All the pipe is doing here is passing the output of `lsof` to `xargs`, and all `xargs` is doing is taking some input and providing it as an argument to the `kill` command. All-told, that comes out to:

```sh
lsof -ti tcp:$i | xargs kill
```

That‚Äôs digital plumbing babey; we‚Äôre doing steampunk in cyberspace ‚Äî and they said it couldn't be done.

## Conclusion

Gosh, thanks for reading, and gosh I hope it was useful! I am very certain there are one thousand and one enhancements that could be made for this puppy, so if you‚Äôd like to hit me with the Um Actually To End All Um Actuallies, [shoot me an email](mailto:yo@henry.codes?subject=You%20Fool.%20You%20Absolute%20Goombus.%20What%20Were%20You%20Thinking.). Like I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôd also love to make this article serve Windows and Linux users, so def get in touch about that too :D
