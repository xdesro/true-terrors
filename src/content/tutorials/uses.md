This is a non-exhaustive list of the tools I use in my day-to-day operation for design, development, and life as a human. If I'm missing something, [let me know](mailto:yo@henry.codes?subject=Request%20To%20Add%20To%20Uses%3A)!

## Hardware

- **Main Computer** â€” 2023 MacBook Pro, 14-inch, 16GB M2
- **Webcam** â€” Onboard Mac laptop camera ~~Logitech C920 Pro HD~~
- **Microphone** â€” Blue Microphones [Yeti Blackout](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/). Got it for streaming, use it for everything.
- **Keys** â€” GK64 custom build, with an acacia case, Elven keycaps, and Kailh box jade switches.
- **Phone** â€” iPhone 14 Pro 256GB. Wouldnâ€™t recommend it. I donâ€™t think Apple holds the future of phones anymore. Might try a [Nothing phone](https://us.nothing.tech/) next.
- **Headphones** â€” [Nothing ear(open)](https://us.nothing.tech/products/ear-open) for being out and about, [Nothing ear(2)](https://us.nothing.tech/products/ear) for when I need noise canceling, and [Sennheiser HD 650](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/high-quality-headphones-around-ear-audio-surround-hd-650)at home. Love the wide sound stage.
- **Luggage** â€” [Chrome Niko Pack](https://www.chromeindustries.com/product/niko-pack-backpack/BG-153.html) laptop & camera bag. It's like bulletproof, effectively waterproof, and looks really tech-wear-y and rad.

## Software

- **IDE** â€” VS Code.
  - _Theme_: [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/visual-studio-code) or [Horizon Light](https://horizontheme.com/) (_I know, \*GASP\*, a light theme_) depending on the day (and the time of day).
  - _Font_: `Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;` ~~SF Mono with a Fira Code fallback.~~
  - _Must-Have Extensions_: Prettier, ~~GitLens & Vetur.~~
- **Terminal** â€” I like [Hyper.js](https://hyper.is/) â€” recently switched from iTerm almost solely based on the visual customization and JSON-based (instead of GUI) config.
  - _Theme_: Nord, again.
  - _Prompt_: Used to be a die-hard `oh-my-zsh` user, but it's more than I need by a lot. Now I just use [Spaceship](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/).
- **Notes/Content** â€” [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and flat files for almost everything. ~~[Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Notion holds my life together. This blog is published using [Contentful](https://contentful.com).~~
- **Messaging** â€” I use [Discord](https://discord.com/app) and [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) to message most folks.
- **UI/Prototype Design** â€” _I use Figma pretty much exclusively now. It just came down to like one frustrating day of fighting with Framer's layout tools._ ~~[Framer X](https://www.framer.com/)! I recently made the switch from Sketch and have not looked back. The code extensibility makes it a must-have for devsigners ðŸ¦„. Figma is also good.~~ 
- **3D Design** â€” Gotta be Cinema 4D. I initially got hooked on it via Devon Ko's _amazing_ [3D For Designers](https://www.3dfordesigners.com/) course and now I can't stop making weird stuff with it. I use Octane Renderer for most things.
- **Memes & One-Off Imagery** â€” Photoshop lol
- **Vector Art & Iconography** â€” Usually the twin swords of Illustrator, and Figma get me sorted. 
- **Music** â€” Spotify for everything. Spotify *used to actually do a really good job of suggesting music I'll like.
- **VPN** â€” It's `${new Date().getCurrentYear()}` â€”  please, please, please use a VPN. I prefer [Nord](https://nordvpn.com/) _(lmao)_ but any one that you pay for is probably decent.
- **Password Management** â€” I use 1Password for login management these days!
- **Productivity**:
  â€” [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a replacement for your Spotlight on Mac OS X that supercharges it with all kinds of useful featureset. It's well worth paying for a license.

## Deprecated
- ~~**Backup Computer** â€” 2015 MacBook Pro, 15" Retina, 2.2GHz Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, Intel Iris Pro.~~
- ~~**Additional Monitors** â€” LG 4K for screen design and browsers/etc. and an LG Ultrawide riding shotgun, vertically-mounted for contextual peripherals (IRC, Telegram, Spotify, usually Hyper too!).~~
- ~~**Tracking** â€” Apple Magic Trackpad in Space Grey~~
