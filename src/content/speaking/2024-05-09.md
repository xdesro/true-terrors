The IndieWeb is a community of developers and designers and web-surfing wraiths connected by a belief in personal websites/domains as identity, digital self-publishing, and perhaps most chiefly owning one's content. In this talk, I explore the key principles of the IndieWeb, and specifically focus on the concept of POSSE (or "Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere"), its benefits, and how it empowers folks to reclaim ownership of their online content or data. I also discuss concrete and actionable strategies for implementing POSSE in one's own online presence and the potential impact it can have on the wider web.
